# UsefulScripts

Bunch of Scripts I use frequently



# ObjectPool.cs


I didn't make the script, but the original author removed the site where this was available.


ObjectPool.CreatePool(PREFAB,Number of Instances);


ObjectPool.Spawn(PREFAB,position,rotation);


# LevelCreator.cs

Made for Unity

Randomly creates a simple map based on a simple tile
